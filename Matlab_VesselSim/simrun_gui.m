% This will run the VesselSim (not signal plotting) part of the
% now-diversified simple_vessel_sim, and will produce as an output, a
% matrix of stored phase information with dimensions N (number of repeats)
% by S (number of recorded steps), and a structure p containing all the
% necessary information.
