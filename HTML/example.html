            Here is a paragraph full of interesting writing.
            Now there will be a line <br />
            break. <br />
            Wasn't that exciting?
        </p>

        <center><p>
            This line is in the centre (center) of the page
        </p></center>

        <p>Below will be a horizontal line</p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            If you want to make sure that a set of words always appears on the same line, you can
            replace the normal spaces with the non-breaking space character "&amp;nbsp;". Also,
            <b>here is some text that is in bold</b>, <i>and here is some in italics</i>. Wasn't 
            that exciting?

        <h3>
            Attributes
        </h3>

        <p align = "right">
            Here's a right-aligned paragraph, which looks like this &lt;p align = "right"&gt;
        </p>

        <p>
            Most HTML elements have the following attriubtes: <b>id</b> (which can be used to
            uniquely identify any element); <b>title</b> (which functions in a similar way, but
            can also serve as as a tooltip or something); <b>class</b> (which associates an
            element with a particular class within a Cascading Style Sheet); and <b>style</b>
            (which allow you to specify specific CSS features for that element). 
        </p>

        <p> 
            Other common attributes are: <b>dir</b> (which can have values "rtl" or "ltr" to
            define which way text is supposed to be read); <b>align</b> (horizontal); <b>valign</b>
            (vertical); <b>bgcolor</b> (when given a numeric, hexidecimal, or RGB colour, places
            it in the background of a particular element); <b>background</b>> (when given a URL,
            places the image from that URL as the background of the element); <b>width</b>; 
            <b>height</b>. And some others...
        </p>

        <p>
            The tag &lt;tt&gt; is used to present text in <tt>monospaced font</tt>. Also, 
            &lt;strike&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;, and &lt;sub&gt;, which should be obvious. Some more are 
            &lt;big&gt; <big>big</big>, and &lt;small&gt; <small>small</small>.
        </p>

        <p>
            &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; can be used to divide a page into smaller sections (span 
            only encompasses inline elements, whereas div can be larger).
        </p>

        <h3>
            Phrase Tags
        </h3>

        <p>
            Here is some <em>emphasized text</em> (&lt;em&gt;). Here is some that <mark>has been
            marked</mark> (&lt;mark&gt;). There are a bunch of other ones of these. They seem like
            they would be situationally useful at best...
